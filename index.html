<p>This is a beginners journey through the steep learning curve of SAP, utilising SAP resources for ECC6 and then reviewing changes in SAP S/4HANA.</p>
<h4>25/03/2020 - hello world</h4>
<p>I am an accountant that is working on a SAP S/4HANA design and implementation project in the UK and am using the opportunity to look under the hood of SAP an learn as much as I can about the configuration of this ERP system to support my understanding of design decisions and to enable me to provide a better service to the end client.</p>
<h5>Desired outcomes</h5>
<p>In the sandbox system that is available to my team, I wan to be able to configure the system to evidence our core design decisions for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sales &amp; Distribution (SD)</li>
<li>Finance (FI)</li>

</ol>
<h5>Timeline</h5>
<p>My current contract is due to expire at the end of August 2020 and so this seems to be an appropriate time deadline. For SD learning, I would like to complete my learning guide by 29 May 2020. I will use the remaining three months to complete my learning resources for FI.</p>
<p>Lets see how this goes...</p>
